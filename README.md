# PDF-ops

A simple app to Merge and Split pdfs, convert Images to PDF and PDF to images. Just have the required files in the folder named files, and run main.py and choose your option and the required output is generated in the folder named output.

The utils.py file has all the functions to perform the pdf operation, use them directly for more flexibilty in choosing input files and tasks like customising splits, etc.
